# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction

**Project Overview**

This project centers on telecom customer analysis, focusing on predicting churn to enhance churn retention and revenue optimization through targeted campaigns. Utilizing a Gradient Boosting model for prediction and an analytic customer dashboard on Power BI, it enables proactive customer retention and profitability enhancement in the telecom sector. Additionally, interactive visualizations are deployed through Streamlit to offer stakeholders actionable insights via a user-friendly web app interface.

**Technologies Used**

* Python
* Gradient Boosting
* Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTEENN)
* Pandas 
* NumPy
* Streamlit 

**Key Features**

*   **Key Features**
